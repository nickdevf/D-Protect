## Why centralized storage is bad for your sensitive data? üîëüìÑ
 
When you use a password manager or any other vault app, you store your data on a specific location (local or private cloud) this have some critical problems. your important data is centralized, meaning that  whoever controls the location controls the content. The controller can change the content, completely replace it, or just take it away. 
That makes your data vulnerable to attacks, exploitation, and loss. 

This makes centralized storage [local or remote] not optimal for storing important data, each has it's downsides

#### Storage

Remote or Cloud: Denied access to data or data deletion because of billing issues or even policy changes or what ever the service provider says, **You're completely reliant on who is holding your data

Local: Vulnerable to hacks, MITM attacks or just accidental data lose



## But With D-Protect your data is:

 - ‚ú® Secure: and your master password never stored or transmitted.

 - ‚ú® Trustless: Does not require you to trust the password manager company to know your data is safe.

 - ‚ú® Persistent: Stored on the IPFS and Filecoin Network to ensure it's availability.

 - ‚ú® Open source: and open for anyone to study and analyze it's codebase.

 - ‚ú® Provable Ownership: Where you own your data the same way you own your FIL or bitcoin in your wallet, (wallet integration is coming soon).
